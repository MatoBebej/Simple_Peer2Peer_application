Aplication coded in Python for my PKS collega class, it enables simple peer 2 peer communication along with features such as hnadshake, KAL (keep alive functionality), and is able to not only transfer messeges but also files.
There are also meassures that controlll if packets are not being corrupted, and there is optionality to temper with files, to check that feature.
